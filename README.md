<p align="center">
A Prism3D plugin that takes over cabin screens (GPS, dashboard, or any custom accessory) in <b>Euro Truck Simulator 2</b> (or American Truck Simulator) and mirrors a live captured window onto them.
</p>

---

## What it does
Press **Ctrl+F8** in game to open an ImGui overlay. From there you can:
- Add a **GPS** screen, **Dashboard** screen, or a **Custom** screen (The target `.tobj` MUST be a functional screen from a UI Script, such as `/ui/gps.sii`)
- Pick a running application window as the source for that screen
- Adjust target resolution and framerate
- Apply changes 

Whatever's rendering in the picked window gets captured and blitted onto the truck's screen every frame.

## How it works
### 1. Redirecting the texture file
A hook on Prism3D's `memserver_texture_queue_processor` walks the engine's pending texture object queue every tick. If a queued `tobj`'s path matches a screen's `original_texture` (e.g. `/vehicle/truck/share/gps.tobj`), the path is swapped for `override_texture` before the engine loads it.

### 2. Catching the texture at creation time
The override `.tobj` still gets built into a real DirectX texture eventually, there's a hook on `ID3D11Device::CreateTexture2D`. Every creation call is checked against a fignerprint. The real game textures never match the fingerprint, so it's whats used to capture the screens texture.

*This method is a bit "jank"... but it does work ;)*

Once matched, the description is rewritten before the real `CreateTexture2D` is called:
```cpp
D3D11_TEXTURE2D_DESC modifiedDesc = *pDesc;
modifiedDesc.Format = DXGI_FORMAT_R8G8B8A8_UNORM;
modifiedDesc.Usage = D3D11_USAGE_DYNAMIC;
modifiedDesc.CPUAccessFlags = D3D11_CPU_ACCESS_WRITE;
modifiedDesc.MiscFlags = 0;
modifiedDesc.Width = screen.targetLiveTextureWidth;
modifiedDesc.Height = screen.targetLiveTextureHeight;
```

This gives us a CPU writable arbitrarily sized texture instead of the default game texture -  then the resulting texture and its immediate context are cached on the `screen_t` for later.

### 3. Feeding it frames
Every present call, each screen with a live texture and an active source:
- Pulls the latest RGBA8 frame from its content source
- `Map()`s the live texture with `D3D11_MAP_WRITE_DISCARD`
- Copies row by row using nearest neighbor sampling if source and destination sizes differ, with an optional vertical flip
- `Unmap()`s it

### 4. Forcing the screens to actually render
The GPS/dashboard/custom screens are normally only drawn under specific in game conditions. `dllmain.cpp` patches the relevant conditional jump in the games process, flipping `JE` to `JMP` (and back) at runtime so the screen's render path is unconditionally taken whenever a screen of that type exists, and restored to normal when it doesn't. Addresses are found via pattern scanning, so it hopefully survives most game updates.

## Content sources
Windows applications can be captured with **`WindowSource`** (`PrintWindow` + `GetDIBits`) or **`WgcWindowSource`** (Windows Graphics Capture). A first-stage **Linux bridge source** accepts bounded RGBA8 frames from a native test sender over localhost, allowing the Windows DLL to remain inside an ETS2 Proton process.

The source uses a interface `IContentSource`, so other backends (a video file source, a mintor source, etc) can be implimented very easially in the future without touching the DX11 or menu code.

See [Linux/Wayland bridge: stage 1](docs/linux-bridge.md) for the protocol, native sender build, and exact Proton test steps. Portal/PipeWire capture is intentionally not part of this stage.

## Requirements
- MinHook
- Dear ImGui
- SCS Telemetry SDK
- DirectX 11

## Known issues
- Fingerprinting textures by dimensions/format means any other texture in the game that happens to match GPS/dashboard's size and format exactly would get caught too which is unlikely (if using unqiue dimentions), but not impossible.
- Custom screens have no override_texture_size_w/h wiring in the menu yet, unlike GPS/Dashboard.

## Usage

1. Drop the compiled plugin DLL into your ETS2/ATS `plugins` folder (not a injected DLL)
2. Launch the game, Ctrl+F8 to open the menu
3. Add a screen, pick a source window, hit Apply

## Contributing
PRs and issues are welcome, keep in mind:

- If a pattern scan fails to resolve on a newer patch, that's the first thing to check before assuming something else is broken. (Same with any Prism3D structures inside `prism/prism.h`)
- DO NOT use hard coded file offsets etc, keep with using pattern scans where possible.
- If you're adding a new `IContentSource` (video file, monitor capture, etc.), implement it against the existing interface in `sources/content_source.h`.
- Match existing code style so diffs stay reviewable and the project isnt a mess of multiple people.
- Test on an actual ETS2 install before opening a PR.
